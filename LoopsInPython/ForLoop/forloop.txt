A for loop is used for iterating over a sequence
(that is either a list, a tuple, a dictionary, a set,
or a string).

This is less like the for keyword in other programming
language, and works more like an iterator method as
found in other object-orientated programming languages.

With the for loop we can execute a set of statements,
once for each item in a list, tuple, set etc.
