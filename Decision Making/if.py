'''Decision making is anticipation of conditions 
occurring while execution of the program and 
specifying actions taken according to the conditions.'''

'''Decision structures evaluate multiple expressions 
which produce TRUE or FALSE as outcome. 
You need to determine which action to take and 
which statements to execute if outcome is TRUE or FALSE otherwise.'''
